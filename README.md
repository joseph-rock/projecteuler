# projecteuler

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) is a set of small math-specific coding challenges. My solutions are written in TypeScript run via [Deno](https://deno.land), utilizing the [Ramda](https://ramdajs.com/) library.

This repo is a work in progress, I come back to these problems from time to time.
